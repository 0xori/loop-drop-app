## Overview

### Create sounds and load samples

Drop them where you want on your controllers then start jamming!

### Everything you play is recorded.

Hit the loop button at any time. Whatever you just played will start to loop!

### Play to the beat.
            
Use beat repeat and hold down buttons to trigger at different rates relative to tempo.

### Transform your loops while they play.

Select, move, repeat, suppress. All using your hardware controller.
