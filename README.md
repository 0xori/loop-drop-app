#### Create sounds and load samples

Drop them where you want on your controllers then start jamming!

#### Everything you play is recorded.

Hit the loop button at any time. Whatever you just played will start to loop!

#### Play to the beat.

Use beat repeat and hold down buttons to trigger at different rates relative to tempo.

#### Transform your loops while they play.

Select, move, repeat, suppress. All using your hardware controller.

## ...or Build and Install from source

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-drop-app.git
$ cd loop-drop-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Troubleshooting

If you receive an error on start up about missing `lib/*`, you may have to [run the following as administrator](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/run-a-command-as-administrator-from-the-windows-vista-run-box/):

#### Windows

```bash
# run admin
$ node scripts/link-lib.js
```

#### Linux

```bash
$ sudo node scripts/link-lib.js
```

If it still doesn't work, try copying the `/lib` folder into `/node_modules`.

### Installing updates

New versions are being pushed out all the time. To update:

```bash
$ git pull
$ npm update
$ npm start
```

### You can also install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loop-drop)
